GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#13;
                       Version 2, June 1991&#13;
&#13;
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#13;
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#13;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#13;
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#13;
&#13;
                            Preamble&#13;
&#13;
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#13;
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#13;
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free&#13;
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This&#13;
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#13;
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to&#13;
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by&#13;
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to&#13;
your programs, too.&#13;
&#13;
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#13;
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#13;
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#13;
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it&#13;
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it&#13;
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#13;
&#13;
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#13;
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.&#13;
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you&#13;
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#13;
&#13;
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#13;
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#13;
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#13;
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their&#13;
rights.&#13;
&#13;
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and&#13;
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,&#13;
distribute and/or modify the software.&#13;
&#13;
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain&#13;
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free&#13;
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we&#13;
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so&#13;
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original&#13;
authors' reputations.&#13;
&#13;
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#13;
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free&#13;
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the&#13;
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any&#13;
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.&#13;
&#13;
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#13;
modification follow.&#13;
&#13;
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#13;
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#13;
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#13;
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,&#13;
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"&#13;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&#13;
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#13;
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&#13;
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&#13;
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".&#13;
&#13;
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#13;
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#13;
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&#13;
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#13;
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#13;
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#13;
&#13;
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's&#13;
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#13;
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#13;
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&#13;
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&#13;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#13;
along with the Program.&#13;
&#13;
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&#13;
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#13;
&#13;
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#13;
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#13;
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#13;
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#13;
&#13;
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#13;
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#13;
&#13;
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&#13;
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#13;
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#13;
    parties under the terms of this License.&#13;
&#13;
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#13;
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#13;
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&#13;
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#13;
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#13;
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#13;
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&#13;
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#13;
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&#13;
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#13;
&#13;
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#13;
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#13;
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#13;
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#13;
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#13;
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#13;
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#13;
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#13;
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#13;
&#13;
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#13;
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#13;
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#13;
collective works based on the Program.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&#13;
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&#13;
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#13;
the scope of this License.&#13;
&#13;
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&#13;
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&#13;
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#13;
&#13;
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#13;
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#13;
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#13;
&#13;
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#13;
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#13;
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#13;
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#13;
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#13;
    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#13;
&#13;
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#13;
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#13;
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#13;
    received the program in object code or executable form with such&#13;
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#13;
&#13;
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#13;
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&#13;
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&#13;
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&#13;
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&#13;
special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#13;
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#13;
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&#13;
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#13;
itself accompanies the executable.&#13;
&#13;
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#13;
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#13;
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#13;
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&#13;
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#13;
&#13;
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#13;
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#13;
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&#13;
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&#13;
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&#13;
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&#13;
parties remain in full compliance.&#13;
&#13;
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#13;
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#13;
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&#13;
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#13;
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#13;
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#13;
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#13;
the Program or works based on it.&#13;
&#13;
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&#13;
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#13;
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&#13;
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#13;
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.&#13;
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#13;
this License.&#13;
&#13;
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#13;
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#13;
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#13;
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#13;
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#13;
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#13;
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#13;
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#13;
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&#13;
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#13;
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#13;
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#13;
&#13;
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&#13;
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&#13;
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#13;
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#13;
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#13;
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#13;
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#13;
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#13;
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#13;
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#13;
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#13;
impose that choice.&#13;
&#13;
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#13;
be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#13;
&#13;
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&#13;
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#13;
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#13;
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#13;
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&#13;
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#13;
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#13;
&#13;
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#13;
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#13;
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#13;
address new problems or concerns.&#13;
&#13;
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#13;
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any&#13;
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#13;
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&#13;
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&#13;
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#13;
Foundation.&#13;
&#13;
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&#13;
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&#13;
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&#13;
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&#13;
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&#13;
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&#13;
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#13;
&#13;
                            NO WARRANTY&#13;
&#13;
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&#13;
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&#13;
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&#13;
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&#13;
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&#13;
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS&#13;
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE&#13;
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&#13;
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#13;
&#13;
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#13;
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR&#13;
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,&#13;
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING&#13;
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED&#13;
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#13;
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER&#13;
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE&#13;
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#13;
&#13;
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#13;
&#13;
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#13;
&#13;
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#13;
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&#13;
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#13;
&#13;
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&#13;
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#13;
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#13;
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#13;
&#13;
    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#13;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#13;
&#13;
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify&#13;
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#13;
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or&#13;
    (at your option) any later version.&#13;
&#13;
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#13;
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#13;
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#13;
    GNU General Public License for more details.&#13;
&#13;
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#13;
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#13;
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#13;
&#13;
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#13;
&#13;
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this&#13;
when it starts in an interactive mode:&#13;
&#13;
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#13;
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.&#13;
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#13;
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.&#13;
&#13;
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate&#13;
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may&#13;
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be&#13;
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#13;
&#13;
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#13;
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if&#13;
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#13;
&#13;
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program&#13;
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.&#13;
&#13;
  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#13;
  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#13;
&#13;
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into&#13;
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may&#13;
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the&#13;
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General&#13;
Public License instead of this License.</description>
